          <textarea id="encodeTextArea" rows="4" cols="50">Ricardo Nicolau has been denounced for abuse of economic power, however, the judge entrusted with the cases is a friend of the candidate's sister-in-law. State congressman Ricardo Nicolau saw the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to bring forward the Electoral campaign for Mayor of Manaus by months. His family owns the largest private Hospital Chain in the state of Amazonas, Samel, which was entrusted with the administration of the Gilberto Novaes Municipal field hospital, hardly set up in April through a public-private partnership with Manaus City council. Once the disease began spreading throughout the state, the PSD party Congressman took a leave of absence to "dedicate himself entirely to fighting the coronavirus as a director of Samel". Before the unit was closed down in June, Nicolau took advantage of his privileged access to the field hospital to record images that are now being used in an election crusade. The images, which appear to have been filmed by professionals, show the candidate dressed in white, visiting patients, as if he were one of the hospital's doctors - implying that he was responsible for the hundreds of patients passing through the hospital getting treatment. The strategy boosted Nicolau’s ratings in the polls and gave him the chance to dispute the second round of votes for mayor of Manaus. He began the campaign in fourth place, with around 5% of the votes, however the most recent Ibope poll, released on 11th November, places him third with 14% of the votes, technically tied with second-placed David Almeida, who has 18%. This marketing campaign may also be an electoral irregularity. There are at least 10 ongoing lawsuits filed against the candidate by his opponents in the election, citing the use he has made of Samel and his conduct in the hospital during the campaign. Four of these lawsuits are being processed by the office of election Judge Margareth Rose Cruz Hoaegen. Two of them are still pending analysis, but she has already revealed what her interpretation of the facts is likely to entail by stating that "there is no evidence that such conduct upsets the balance of the election race”. She has judged two cases: one filed by the campaign of the candidate for mayor Alfredo Nascimento, from the PL party, and another by the campaign of fellow candidate and former governor Amazonino Mendes, from the Podemos party. Both question the use of the name of the Samel Group and the images filmed inside the public field hospital by Nicolau, alleging that this constitutes an abuse of economic power and illegal marketing. Hoaegen’s ruling states that the "candidate’s association with the healthcare company [Samel]" is undeniable, but this is not an issue due to the fact "the healthcare company is part of the candidate’s trajectory, so taking full advantage of his achievements as a means of demonstrating professional success is part of his campaign platforms ". The lawsuit lodged by the campaign of his opponent Nascimento also denounced the fact that Nicolau was using Samel’s database, due to videos featuring testimonials from patients admitted to the field hospital. The judge was of the understanding that  "the candidate could be using data from the information bank " and prohibited him from sending " electronic messages and physical correspondence and for making telephone calls to voters registered in the aforementioned database". Nicolau denies having used any confidential patient data. One of the videos aired in the free election time slot on 12th October featured a woman admitted to the field hospital with COVID-19, who said that “Dr. Ricardo Nicolau was very supportive". "He visited every day. It boosted my confidence to see the person responsible for setting up the hospital doing that out of the good of his heart", she said. Similar reports from other people using the term “doctor” were also broadcast in these programmes. Although the candidate insists on using his electoral programs to say he has been “working at the hospital for over 30 years”, and that he set up “a field hospital with 180 beds in 4 days”, Nicolau's professional career has had absolutely nothing to do with the health sector. his first position was as a city counselor in Manaus when he was 21. Today, at 45, he is in his fifth term as a state congressman and is a former president of the legislative assembly of Amazonas. The candidate for mayor wasn't a director of Samel before the pandemic, but he began using the title after relinquishing his position of congressman at the start of the pandemic. Moreover, he isn't a doctor and doesn't even have a university degree, as stated on the TSE website. The white clothing he wears in his campaign videos while visiting patients in their beds is a mere costume. Nicolau’s press office insists that he visited family hospitals with his father, who is a doctor, from an early age, and that "he has never reported or insinuated that he was a doctor " and that "he is always dressed in white on a daily basis, but never a lab coat". The magistrate who allowed the congressman to continue using the Samel brand name and his television marketing campaign is also a close friend of Jeanne Nicolau, who is married to his brother, Luis Alberto Nicolau, the CEO of Samel. Photos posted on social networks show that Judge Hoaegen and Nicolau’s sister-in-law are part of a group of friends who get together at birthday parties and restaurants. A photo posted by the magistrate on her Instagram page in January 2018 says she is “celebrating beautiful, dearest Jê" referring to the candidate's sister-in-law, Jeanne. Her profile is closed, but we gain access to a print of the post. Jeanne and the judge were also together at end-of-year events on at least five occasions between 2014 and 2019, according to images of the judge and her friends to which we had access on Instagram. The 2019 party was held at the magistrate's house. Another photo shows the judge celebrating Jean Cleuter’s birthday, Jeanne's brother, Nicolau’s lawyer, and the second biggest individual donor in the congressman's campaign. He donated 250,000 Brazilian real to Nicolau’s campaign, second only to the 1 million Brazilian real donated by the candidate's brother. We contacted the Regional Electoral Court (TRE) and the magistrate, neither of which have replied as of the date on which this report was published. A lawyer specializing in electoral law and coordinator of communication at the Brazilian Academy of Electoral and Political Law, Luiz Eduardo Peccinin, explains that there are many ways in which a candidate can abuse economic power. One is the use of financial or business structures to promote a candidate's election campaign. "If it is proven that he [Ricardo Nicolau] took advantage of the access he had to the services [at the municipal campaign hospital], this could constitute abuse of economic power and could lead to the impeachment of the mandate and the determination of ineligibility", he says. Ricardo Nicolau also exaggerates by saying that he set up the Manaus field hospital. The unit created in the state to treat patients in the most critical phase of the epidemic is the result of public-private partnerships entered into between the city council and several companies besides Samel such as Moto Honda da Amazônia, which built the cafeteria, and the Transire Institute, which donated a tomograph to the amount of 3 million Brazilian real. The general public also helped, making donations to a city council account created for this purpose. The lawsuit filed against Nicolau by the campaign of former governor and co-candidate for Mayor Amazonino Mendes from the Podemos party, argues that the Samel group has been advertising their chain in the free-to-air election campaign slot.
